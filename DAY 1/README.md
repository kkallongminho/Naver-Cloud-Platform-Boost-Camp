ðŸ“˜ Naver Cloud Platform (NCP) Server & Auto Scaling Setup - Summary

ðŸš€ Overview

This project demonstrates how to configure a scalable and secure infrastructure using Naver Cloud Platform (NCP). It covers VPC creation, public/private subnet setup, server deployment, and Auto Scaling with Load Balancer integration.

ðŸ”§ Infrastructure Configuration

âœ… 1. VPC & Subnet
	â€¢	Created a custom VPC named hnu20222016
	â€¢	Configured two subnets:
	â€¢	hnu-20222016-kr1-prv-sub (Private, 10.29.0.0/24)
	â€¢	hnu-20222016-kr1-pub-sub (Public, 10.29.1.0/24)
	â€¢	Internet Gateway linked to the public subnet for external access

âœ… 2. Server Deployment
	â€¢	Server type: c2-g2-s50 (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 50GB SSD)
	â€¢	OS image: Custom image hnu-20222016
	â€¢	Servers deployed in private subnet with Load Balancer handling external traffic

âœ… 3. Load Balancer
	â€¢	Protocol: HTTP (Port 80)
	â€¢	Target Group created and connected to Auto Scaling Group
	â€¢	Health check enabled via / endpoint (HTTP 200 expected)

âœ… 4. Auto Scaling Group
	â€¢	Name: hnu-20222016-kr1-prv-sub
	â€¢	VPC: hnu20222016
	â€¢	Desired Capacity: 2 (initially)
	â€¢	Health Check: Load Balancer-based
	â€¢	Scaling Policy: CPU utilization > 30% triggers scale-out
	â€¢	Cooldown: 300 seconds

â¸»

ðŸ“¡ Monitoring & Alerts
	â€¢	Connected to Cloud Insight for real-time monitoring
	â€¢	Event Rule configured:
	â€¢	Metric: avg_cpu_used_rto
	â€¢	Threshold: CPU usage > 30% for 1 minute
	â€¢	Action: Send alert via SMS/Email and trigger Auto Scaling

ðŸ§¹ Resource Cleanup

To properly delete all resources:
	1.	Stop Cloud Insight Monitoring (delete Event Rule)
	2.	Set desired capacity to 0 in Auto Scaling Group
	3.	Delete Auto Scaling Group
	4.	Terminate all related servers
	5.	Delete associated Load Balancer, Target Group, NAT Gateway
	6.	Finally, delete the Subnet and VPC
